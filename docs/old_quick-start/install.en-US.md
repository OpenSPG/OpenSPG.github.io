## 1 Background

OpenSPG is developed based on Java & Python, the server side developed using the open-source framework [`SOFABoot`](https://www.sofastack.tech/projects/sofa-boot/overview/) from Ant Group, and the client side developed using Python3. The standalone version requires `Mysql` for storing server-side metadata and `ElasticSearch` for indexing the SPG data.

The server side of OpenSPG can be quickly installed using `Docker Compose`. The relevant image addresses can be found at [`Docker Images`](https://hub.docker.com/repositories/baifuyu), which includes the following two images:

| Module Name   | Image Name                   | Description                                                                         |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| openspg       | baifuyu/openspg:latest       | The server image of OpenSPG, developed based on Java                                |
| openspg-mysql | baifuyu/openspg-mysql:latest | The database image of OpenSPG that initializes some tables and data, based on Mysql |

In addition to the above 2 Docker images, to start the OpenSPG service, you also need 2 additional Docker images:

| Module Name   | Image Name                            | Description                                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| tugraph       | tugraph/tugraph-runtime-centos7:4.0.1 | The graph storage image of OpenSPG, used for storing graph data    |
| elasticsearch | elasticsearch:8.5.3                   | The search engine image of OpenSPG, used for indexing the SPG data |

The OpenSPG client can be installed using the `pip` package management tool for `Python`, with a minimum required version of `Python` being >=3.8.

## 2 Quick installation

### 2.1 Client Installation

To quickly install the client, execute the following command:

```bash
pip install openspg-knext
```

To verify if the `OpenSPG` client has been successfully installed, use the `knext` command:

```bash
knext --version
```

### 2.2 Server Installation

1. Install `Docker` on your local machine. <br>
   You can refer to the official documentation for the environment setup: [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

2. The `Docker Compose` configuration file is as follows. Copy the following content and save it as `docker-compose.yml` on your local machine. Then, use the following command to start the installation:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

The content of `the docker-compose.yml` file is as follows:

```yaml
version: '3.7'
services:
  openspg:
    restart: always
    image: baifuyu/openspg:latest
    container_name: release-openspg
    ports:
      - '8887:8887'
    depends_on:
      - mysql
      - tugraph
      - elasticsearch
    command:
      [
        '--cloudext.repository.impl.jdbc.host=mysql',
        '--builder.operator.python.exec=/usr/bin/python3.8',
        '--builder.operator.python.paths=/usr/lib/python3.8/site-packages;/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages;',
      ]
    environment:
      - PYTHONPATH=/usr/lib/python3.8/site-packages:/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages

  mysql:
    restart: always
    image: baifuyu/openspg-mysql:latest

    ports:
      - '3306:3306'
    command:
      [
        '--character-set-server=utf8mb4',
        '--collation-server=utf8mb4_general_ci',
      ]

  tugraph:
    image: tugraph/tugraph-runtime-centos7:4.0.1
    container_name: release-openspg-tugraph
    # default username is admin and default password is 73@TuGraph
    ports:
      - '7070:7070'
      - '9090:9090'
    command: lgraph_server

  elasticsearch:
    image: elasticsearch:8.5.3
    container_name: test-openspg-elasticsearch
    ports:
      - '9200:9200'
      - '9300:9300'
    environment:
      - discovery.type=single-node
      - xpack.security.enabled=false
```

During the first installation, Docker images for the above 4 services need to be downloaded. The downloading speed might be a bit slow. Please be patient and wait.

Once the server and client are installed and started, we can begin creating our first knowledge graph.
