In the OpenSPG framework, we have designed the SPG2LPG-Translator module to accommodate various graph storage and graph computing engines from different vendors. Users can easily extend the functionalities of their graph engines by inheriting and implementing specific interfaces.

We will release this module in the upcoming version. Stay tuned!
