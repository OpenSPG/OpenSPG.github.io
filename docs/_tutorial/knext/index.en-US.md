This article will introduce the usage of KNext, the Python SDK in OpenSPG, including both the command line tool and the programmable SDK.

With the KNext command line tool, you can perform various tasks such as creating graph projects, schema modifications, knowledge building, querying knowledge data, and performing inference.

## 1 Installation Guide

### 1.1 Supported Python Versions

python>=3.8

### 1.2 Installing KNext

It is recommended to install KNext in a virtual environment to avoid conflicts between KNext dependencies and system packages. You can use the pip tool to install a specific version of KNext:

```bash
pip install openspg-knext
```

Verify the installation by checking the KNext version:

```bash
knext --version
```

## 2 Quick Start

This example can help you quickly start with importing and analyzing inference on a simple knowledge graph.

### 2.1 Set Server Address

Execute the following command to set the server address of OpenSPG (by default it's http://127.0.0.1:8887 for local address):

```bash
knext config set --global host_addr=http://127.0.0.1:8887
```

### 2.2 Create Project

Execute the following command to create a project. It will generate an example project folder in the current directory with the folder name in lowercase, which is the namespace:

```bash
knext project create --name example_project --namespace Prj --desc "this is an example project"
```

### 2.3 Switch Project

Execute the following command to enter the project directory. All operations related to this project should be performed within the project directory:

```bash
cd prj
```

The project includes:

- An example entity `Prj.Demo`, declared in `/schema/prj.schema`, used for creating the schema of the project.

```
namespace Prj

Demo("example entity"): EntityType
    properties:
        demoProperty("example property"): Text
```

- A build job `Demo`, defined in `builder/job/demo.py`, used for importing the `Prj.Demo` entity.

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

from knext.core.builder.job.model.builder_job import BuilderJob
from knext.core.builder.job.model.component import SourceCsvComponent, EntityMappingComponent, SinkToKgComponent
from schema.prj_schema_helper import Prj


class Demo(BuilderJob):

    def build(self):
        source = SourceCsvComponent(
            local_path="./builder/job/data/Demo.csv",
            columns=["id", 'prop'],
            start_row=2
        )

        mapping = EntityMappingComponent(
            spg_type_name=Prj.Demo
        ).add_field("id", Prj.Demo.id)
        .add_field("prop", Prj.Demo.demoProperty)

    sink = SinkToKgComponent()

    return source >> mapping >> sink

```

- An extraction operator `DemoExtractOp`, defined in `builder/operator/demo_extract.py`.

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

from typing import List, Dict

from knext.core.builder.operator import Vertex
from knext.core.builder.operator.model.op import KnowledgeExtractOp


class DemoExtractOp(KnowledgeExtractOp):

    def __init__(self, params: Dict[str, str] = None):
        super().__init__(params)

    def eval(self, record: Dict[str, str]) -> List[Vertex]:

        return [Vertex(properties=record)]

```

- A DSL query statement, declared in `reasoner/demo.dsl`, used to query all `Prj.Demo` entities.

```
MATCH (s:Prj.Demo)
RETURN s.id, s.demoProperty
```

### 2.4 Create Schema

```bash
knext schema commit
```

- After executing this command, the schema declaration in `/schema/prj.schema` will be submitted to the server.

### 2.5 Publish Operator

```bash
knext operator publish DemoExtractOp
```

- After executing this command, it will scan all the operators under `builder/operator` and publish the `DemoExtractOp` operator to the server.

### 2.6 Knowledge Builder

```bash
knext builder submit Demo
```

- After executing this command, it will scan all the knowledge building jobs under `builder/job` (that inherit from the `BuilderJob` class) and submit `Demo` to the server.

### 2.7 Knowledge Query

```bash
knext reasoner query --file reasoner/demo.dsl
```

- After executing this command and specifying the `--file` option with the file containing KGDSL query statements, the queries will be submitted to the server for execution. The server will process the queries and return the query results synchronously.

```

- `.knext.cfg`
  It is the configuration file for the project. Most of the configuration information remains fixed, but when adjusting the project directory structure, it needs to be modified using the `knext config set --local key=value` command. It is automatically generated and populated with default configurations when creating a new project. The default configurations are as follows:

```bash
[local]
project_name = RiskMining
description = "risk mining project"
project_id = 2
namespace = RiskMining
project_dir = riskmining
schema_dir = schema
schema_file = riskmining.schema
builder_dir = builder
builder_operator_dir = builder/operator
builder_record_dir = builder/error_record
builder_job_dir = builder/job
builder_model_dir = builder/model
reasoner_dir = reasoner
reasoner_result_dir = reasoner/result
```

- `project_name` The name of the project, specified when creating the project using the [--name] parameter. It cannot be modified.
- `description` The description of the project, specified when creating the project using the [--desc] parameter.
- `project_id` The project ID, automatically assigned when creating the project. If using the `knext project create [--prj_pth]` command, a new ID will be generated and replace the original one.
- `namespace` The prefix for project schemas, specified when creating the project using the [--namespace] parameter. It cannot be modified.
- `project_dir` The root directory of the project, defaulting to `namespace.lower()` when creating the project. If the folder already exists, this configuration needs to be modified.
- `schema_dir` The directory for schemas, defaulting to `schema` when creating the project.
- `schema_file` The file name for the schema declaration, defaulting to `${namespace.lower()}.schema` when creating the project. If the file already exists, this configuration needs to be modified.
- `builder_dir` The directory for building jobs, defaulting to `builder` when creating the project. If the directory changes, this configuration needs to be modified.
- `builder_operator_dir` The directory for operators, defaulting to `builder/operator` when creating the project. If the directory changes, this configuration needs to be modified.
- `builder_record_dir` The directory for storing records of building jobs, defaulting to `builder/record` when creating the project. If the directory changes, this configuration needs to be modified.
- `builder_job_dir` The directory for jobs, defaulting to `builder/job` when creating the project. If the directory changes, this configuration needs to be modified.
- `builder_model_dir` The directory for algorithm models, defaulting to `builder/model` when creating the project. If the directory changes, this configuration needs to be modified.
- `reasoner_dir` The directory for reasoning jobs, defaulting to `reasoner` when creating the project. If the directory changes, this configuration needs to be modified.
- `reasoner_result_dir` The directory for storing rule inference results, defaulting to `reasoner/result` when creating the project. If the directory changes, this configuration needs to be modified.
- `builder` The directory used to store all the knowledge building jobs, source data dependencies, self-defined operators, algorithm models, and error records.
- `reasoner` The directory used to store KGDSL syntax files and execution results.
  - KGDSL syntax files have the `.dsl` extension and are used to store KGDSL query statements.
- `schema` The directory used to store the schema declarations and concept rules of the project.
  - Project schema declaration files have the `.schema` extension. They are parsed and committed to the server using the `knext schema commit` command. Each project can have only one unique schema declaration file.
  - Concept rules have the `.rule` extension and can be registered to corresponding concepts using the `knext schema reg_concept_rule [--file]` command.

## 5 python SDK

### 5.1 Writing a Knowledge Building Job

`BuilderJob` is the base class for all knowledge building jobs.
Any class that inherits from `BuilderJob` under `{builder_job_dir}` will be recognized by knext as a building job. Building jobs can be submitted to the server for asynchronous execution using the `knext builder submit [name]` command.
All building jobs must implement the `build` method, which defines the execution flow of the job.

#### 5.1.1 Parameters

| Parameter          | Type              | Required or not | Example                  | Description                                                                                                           |

| **operation_type** | OperationTypeEnum | no              | OperationTypeEnum.Create | Operation type for the building job [default is Create, which means data is written in an incremental update manner]. |
| **lead_to**        | bool              | no              | True                     | Whether to execute CAU(causality) [default is False].                                                                 |

#### 5.1.2 Interface

##### 5.1.2.1 build(self)

The interface implements the execution logic of a knowledge building job, essentially defining the pipeline flow between each execution node, where each execution node is a component that inherits from the `Component` base class.

The dependency relationship between components is defined using the `>>` right shift operator (knext has overloaded the `__rshift__` method), and the build method should return the pipeline structure. The example is as follows:

```python
class App(BuilderJob):

    def build(self):
        source = SourceCsvComponent(...)

        mapping = EntityMappingComponent(...)

        sink = SinkToKgComponent(...)

        return source >> mapping >> sink

### 5.3 Operators

`BaseOp` is the base class for all operators, while `KnowledgeExtractOp/EntityLinkOp/PropertyNormalizeOp/EntityFuseOp` inherit from `BaseOp` to differentiate different types of operators.

All classes that inherit from `BaseOp` under `{builder_operator_dir}` will be recognized as an operator by Knext. Operators can be published to the server using the command `knext operator publish [op_name]`.

All operators must implement the `eval` method, which defines the execution logic of the operator.

#### 5.3.1 Parameters

| Parameter   | Type | Required or not | Example                                       | Description                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------- | ---- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **desc**    | str  | no              | "The operator for certificate entity linking" | The description of the operator. <br> [Default is empty]                                                                                      |
| **bind_to** | str  | no              | "RiskMining.Cert"                             | The entity type which is bounded to the operator. <br> The extraction operator does not support binding entity types. <br> [Default is empty] |

#### 5.3.2 Interface

##### 5.3.2.1 **init**(self, params: Dict[str, str] = None)

The initialization method for the operators, which is executed only once during the initialization stage after the building job is submitted. Different operators inherit the `__init__` method.

If the self-defined operator does not override the initialization method, it will default to `self.params=params`. When the component sets operator parameters `params` using the `set_operator` method, the operator can access the corresponding parameter `value` using `self.params[key]`, enabling reuse of the same operator for different building jobs.

If the self-defined operator needs to initialize external clients such as `SearchClient`, you can override the `__init__` method to avoid repeated initialization of the client.

##### 5.3.2.2 eval(self, \*args)

The self-defined operators need to override the `eval` method to implement the execution logic. The `eval` method of different operators may have different input parameters and output result.

#### 5.3.3 Data structure

##### 5.3.3.1 Vertex

The input and output entity information (including entity ID, entity type, and entity properties) of the operator is encapsulated in the `Vertex` type.

| Parameter       | Type           | Required or not | Example                                                                 | Description       |
| --------------- | -------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **biz_id**      | str            | no              | "1"                                                                     | entity ID         |
| **vertex_type** | str            | no              | DEFAULT.Cert                                                            | entity type       |
| **properties**  | Dict[str, str] | yes             | {"id": "1", "name": "1", "certNum": "68802adde35845d76eeb172ff8ea6825"} | entity properties |

#### 5.3.4 Example

```python
class CertLinkerOperator(EntityLinkOp):
    bind_to = "DEFAULT.Cert"

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.search_client = SearchClient("DEFAULT.Cert")

    def eval(self, property: str, record: Vertex) -> List[Vertex]:
        query = {"match": {"certNum": property}}
        recall_certs = self.search_client.search(query, 0, 10)
        if recall_certs is not None:
            return [Vertex(biz_id=recall_certs[0].doc_id, vertex_type="RiskMining.Cert")]
        return [Vertex(biz_id=has_cert, vertex_type="RiskMining.Cert")]
```

Executing the command `knext operator publish CertLinkerOperator` will publish a new version of the operator to the server, and bind the new version of the operator named "CertLinkerOperator" to the `DEFAULT.Cert` entity type.

When executing a building job of the `DEFAULT.Cert` entity type, the `eval` method will be executed to perform certificate linking.

#### 5.3.5 KnowledgeExtractOp

The knowledge extraction operators need to inherit `KnowledgeExtractOp`, which is responsible for extracting structured data from unstructured data and can also perform data preprocessing.

##### 5.3.5.1 Interface

###### eval(self, record: Dict[str, str]) -> List[Vertex]:

#### 5.3.6 PropertyNormalizeOp

The property normalization operators are typically bound to the `ConceptType`. They are responsible for standardizing the properties of the concept and performing concept mounting.

The `knext.api` provides the base class `PropertyNormalizeOp` for the property normalization operators. By inheriting and implementing the `eval` method, you can develop self-defined normalization operators. The KNext pipeline supports configuring linking operators on entity properties in the knowledge mapping component, overriding the operators bound to the entity type in the current job.

##### 5.3.6.1 Interface

###### eval(self, property: str, record: Vertex) -> str:

Input:

- property The property to be normalized
- record The entity instance

Output:

- The normalized property

#### 5.3.7 EntityLinkOp

The entity linking operators are generally bound to the `EntityType` or the `EventType`. They are responsible for recalling the target entity based on the property of the source entity and generating relations between source and target entities.

The entity linking operators can also be used in entity fusion and deduplication. In the operator, entities of the same type can be recalled, and attribute fusion or entity deduplication can be performed based on rules or by executing fusion operators.

The `knext.api` provides the base class `EntityLinkOp` for the entity linking operators. You can develop a linking operators by inheriting and implementing the `eval` method.

##### 5.3.7.1 Interface

###### eval(self, property: str, record: Vertex) -> List[Vertex]:

Input:

- property The property for linking
- record The entity instance

Output:

- The list of entities retrieved from the linking

#### 5.3.8 EntityFuseOp

Not supported yet.
